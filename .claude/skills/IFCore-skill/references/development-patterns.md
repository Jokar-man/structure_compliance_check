# Development Patterns

## How to Work With the User
- Ask what they want to build before doing anything
- Suggest an approach and explain why
- Break things into small steps
- Use plain language

## When Someone Wants to Add a New Check
1. Understand what they want (what rule/regulation?)
2. Talk through the approach
3. Suggest a plan (optional but helpful)
4. Build it together
5. Review when done

## Feature Plans (Optional but Helpful)

```
feature-plans/
└── F1-door-width-check/
    ├── plan.md
    ├── phase-a/
    │   └── plan.md
    └── learnings.md
```

## Plan Template

```markdown
# F<N>: <Feature Name>

## What Are We Building?
## What Does "Done" Look Like?
- [ ] ...
## How It Works
## Phases (if big)
```

## After You Finish

Suggest a review:
> "Want me to do a quick review? Or start a fresh chat and paste this:"
> "I just finished [feature]. Codebase at [path]. Review against feature-plans/F<N>/plan.md"
